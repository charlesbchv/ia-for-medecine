                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>
                    Also called a seizure disorder, epilepsy is a long-term (chronic) neurological disease that affects people of all ages. <br>
                    This condition is characterized by recurrent and unpredictable seizures due to abnormal activity in the brain. These seizures result from excessive and synchronized discharges of a group of neurons in the brain, temporarily disrupting normal brain functions.<br>
                    The formal definition of epilepsy includes the presence of two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart.<br>
                    Epileptic seizures can vary greatly in terms of manifestation and severity, making this disease complex and multifaceted.<br>
                    Around 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy, making it one of the most common neurological diseases globally, according to the World Health Organization.

                    <h2>Causes</h2>
                    <p>The causes of epilepsy are varied and can be classified into several categories:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Genetic Causes:</strong> Some forms of epilepsy are inherited and can be attributed to specific mutations in genes involved in neuronal function.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Structural Causes:</strong> Abnormalities in the brain structure, such as congenital malformations, head trauma, or brain tumors, can provoke seizures.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Metabolic Causes:</strong> Metabolic imbalances, such as disorders in the metabolism of carbohydrates or lipids, can also be the origin of epilepsy.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Infectious Causes:</strong> Infections of the central nervous system, like meningitis or encephalitis, can trigger epileptic seizures.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Immune Causes:</strong> Some epilepsies may be related to immune system dysfunctions, where antibodies attack neurons.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Effects</h2>
                    <p>Epilepsy has significant consequences on the lives of affected individuals, impacting various aspects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Physical Consequences:</strong> There is an increased risk of injuries during seizures, as well as side effects related to medication treatments.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Psychological Consequences:</strong> Depression, anxiety, and mood disorders are frequently observed in epileptic patients.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Social Consequences:</strong> Stigmatization, discrimination, and social isolation are common, affecting quality of life and interpersonal relationships.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Economic Consequences:</strong> The costs associated with healthcare, loss of productivity, and inability to work represent a significant economic burden.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>
                    Experiencing more than two seizures without any known medical history or condition such as alcohool withdrawal or low blood sugar can be a sign of epilepsy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to diagnose this condition, possible tests include :
                </p>
                <ul style="margin-left: auto;">
                    <li><strong>Electroencephalography (EEG)</strong> to measure the electrical activity in the brain;</li>
                    <li><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</strong> to look for tumors, infections or blood vessel abnormalities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    But before making a diagnosis, a consultion with a healthcare provider would be necessary to perform a physical examination.
