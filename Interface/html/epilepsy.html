                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>
                    Also called a seizure disorder, epilepsy is a long-term (chronic) disease that affects people of all ages and causes repeated seizures due to abnormal electrical signals produced by damaged brain cells. Around 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy, making it one of the most common neurological diseases globally, accroding to the World Health Organization.

                    <h2>Causes</h2>
                    <p>Epilepsy can be caused by various factors including genetic influence, head trauma, brain conditions, infectious diseases, prenatal injury, and developmental disorders.</p>

                    <h2>Effects</h2>
                    <p>The effects of epilepsy can vary greatly from person to person and may include physical injury during seizures, emotional challenges, cognitive impacts, and social implications.</p>

                <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>
                    Experiencing more than two seizures without any known medical history or condition such as alcohool withdrawal or low blood sugar can be a sign of epilepsy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to diagnose this condition, possible tests include :
                    <ul>
                        <li>Electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the electrical activity in the brain;</li>
                        <li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for tumors, infections or blood vessel abnormalities.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    But before making a diagnosis, a consultion with a healthcare provider would be necessary to perform a physical examination.
