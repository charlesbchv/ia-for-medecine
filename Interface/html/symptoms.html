                    <p>
                        Depending on where in the brain the disturbance first starts, the seizures can take multiple forms. For example, there can be loss of awareness or consciousness and disturbances of movements, sensation (vision, hearing or taste) or other cognitive functions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some more physical issues, such as fractures or bruising due to seizures, and even psychological disorders, including anxiety and depression can occur for people suffering from epilepsy.

                    <h2>Treatments</h2>
                    <h3>Medication</h3>
                    <p>
                        Up to 70% of people living with epilepsy could become seizure-free with appropriate use of antiseizure medicines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Medications are selected based on the type of seizure, age of the child, side effects, and the adherance with the use of the medication.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Surgery</h3>
                    <p>
                        A possible option is to remove a small part of the brain which is causing the seizures. It may be benefifical to patients who respond poorly to medication.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Ketogenic diet</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mostly recommended for children where medications is not effective, the ketogenic diet is high in fat, moderate in protein and low in carbohydrates, and can help reduce the number of seizures.
